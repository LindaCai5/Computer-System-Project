This assignment builds from assignment 1. You will add a new command line command:
exec prog1 prog2 prog3
and these programs are executed concurrently based on the cpu's quanta.
This new command will simulate the kernel run-time environment, which includes the PCB, the ready
queue, the CPU, and a simple memory. To make this easier we will repurpose code from assignment 1.
In assignment 2 you will maintain a fully working assignment 1 and add to it a kernel run time
environment.
